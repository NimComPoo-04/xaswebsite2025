# Overall Design Principles

These are just simple guidelines please try to stick to them if possible, but its not a hard and fast rule.

1. The UI must be simple and fast
2. Load times of the website should be limited
3. Limited use of Dynamic Elements to reduce development time
4. Decoupling  of the HTML, CSS and JS of the project, this is so it is possible to change design rapidly

# Ideas

Please add you ideas here to keep record,

1. The code of xaswebsite in 2024 suffered from a massive flaw where the content of the site was directly written in html, that greatly reduced redability. To reduce this problem this year we may want to have some form of tooling to generate html from markdown files, or some other document format files.
